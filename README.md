# Uncommon HTML innerHTML Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to using the `innerHTML` property in HTML.  The issue arises when attempting to append content using `innerHTML +=` on an element that already has children, leading to potentially unexpected rendering behavior.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file shows how modifying `innerHTML` after the element already has content can lead to issues. Although it might not throw a JavaScript error, the final rendered output may not be what's expected because the second call to `innerHTML +=` doesn't always behave as expected when appending to the existing innerHTML, potentially overriding or interfering with it.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file provides a solution that utilizes more robust methods for manipulating the DOM, which is a more reliable approach, avoiding the problems associated with directly using `innerHTML` to append and modify content.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe the rendered content. You might find the second element is not rendered as expected, depending on browser rendering behavior.
